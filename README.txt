I used the numpy mod in my backtracking solution to create a matrix.

In order to run Backtrack.py provide a filename and an int between 0 and 2, which is passed in
to define the heuristic. 0 = none; 1 = local; 2 = global.
The test cases formatted testN, with N being the number of friends have more trees than the
test cases formatted as testNa.

In order to run the CandyGame.py provide a filename and an int between 0 and 3, which is
passed in to define opponents. 0 = Mini vs Mini; 1 = Alpha vs Alpha; 2 = Alpha vs Mini; 3 = Mini vs. Alpha
